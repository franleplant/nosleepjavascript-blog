I do too.\nRead on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Isn’t it weird how a lot of developers maintain\nthese sort of inside jokes / memes of hating\ncertain tools and techniques like\nprogramming languages or frameworks?</p>\n<p>It is not the criticism that I find peculiar\nbut the emotional subjective response these folk\nhave toward inanimate things.\nLet’s unpack this aspect of developer culture that we see everyday everywhere.</p>\n<p>I have heard stuff like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Java is a verbose trash.</li>\n<li>Static Typing is extra boilerplate with no benefits.</li>\n<li>Javascript is trash.</li>\n<li>Javascript is crazy (talking about the nasty coercion rules it has).</li>\n<li>Php is the worst language ever.</li>\n<li>Only <em>newbies</em> use PHP.</li>\n<li>PHP is not a real programming language.</li>\n<li><em>Real programmers</em> use Java because it has static typing.</li>\n<li><em>Real programmers</em> use <em>X</em> (programming language, technique, etc).</li>\n<li>Dynamic typing is for newbies.</li>\n<li>Haskell is only for academic purposes.</li>\n<li>Node.js doesn’t have <em>concurrency</em></li>\n<li>Node.js is slow because it doesn’t have threads.</li>\n<li>Javascript’s <em>event-loop</em> is bad.</li>\n<li>I don’t need <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">Typescript</a> (static typing) because I already have <a href=\"https://eslint.org/\">eslint</a> (static analysis).</li>\n<li>and so much more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have heard these at work, at open source communities\nand by speakers in conferences and although it is entirely\nfine for people to resonate and feel more comfortable with\ncertain tools and techniques I believe that is better\nto take a step back and try to think about these tools\nmore objectively, without so much emotion and with a cool head,\nif we do that then we can understand the <strong>trade offs</strong> each tool\nhas and <strong>why was it built like that</strong> and, although we might never use\nit, we will most likely understand why other people might,\nwhen we might want to consider using it\nand the reasoning behind the decisions\nthat lead to that result, which in programming are most\nlikely things we can extrapolate to other areas and\nmaintain a more rich and broad understanding of the vast programming landscape.</p>\n<p>So for example, the other day I saw this meme used for a quick laugh at mostly Javascript.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto;

work or are <strong>incorrect</strong>?\nDoes <a href=\"https://android.jlelse.eu/magic-lies-here-statically-typed-vs-dynamically-typed-languages-d151c7f95e2b\">static typing</a> let you build programs (puzzles) <strong>slower</strong> that do work and are <strong>correctly</strong>?\nAre Statically typed languages fundamentally better than Dynamically typed languages?</p>\n<p>Of course no!</p>\n<p>There is some nuance between the mechanisms by which different\nprogramming languages allow developers to express logic and constraints,\nand how and when they are verified and the errors are handled, one could\ngeneralize Statically Typed languages as allowing more mechanisms to express\nand verify constraints early on (mostly at build time) and\nDynamically Typed languages relying on later “out of band” constraint verifications\ni.e. like doing more automated or manual testing and by doing that they allow\nfaster times to first run.</p>\n<p>But that is a wide spectrum with a lot of nuance, not all statically typed languages\nare the same, some of them provide <a href=\"https://android.jlelse.eu/magic-lies-here-statically-typed-vs-dynamically-typed-languages-d151c7f95e2b\">weaker</a> type systems and good escape hatches,\nand some of them provide <a href=\"https://android.jlelse.eu/magic-lies-here-statically-typed-vs-dynamically-typed-languages-d151c7f95e2b\">strong</a> type systems that at least in my experience tend\nto take more time to “agree with the compiler”.</p>\n<p>After a lot of time spent in Dynamically Typed languages\nsuch as Javascript and <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\">Python</a> now I really value\na good Statically typed language and most of the time\nI do prefer them over untyped because of the capability\nof Statically verifying correctness of my program at least partially,\nbecause of the autocompletion among other things,\nthat is why now a days if I get to chose I only\nwrite <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">Typescript</a> and <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/\">typed Python</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Are Dynamically typed languages the worst of the two every time for every use case?</li>\n<li>Are Dynamically typed languages so sloppy that they let you build weird giraffes (not achieve the desired functionality)?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The answer is a definitive <strong>no</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are some cases where Dynamically Typed languages\nlet you express certain highly dynamic patterns\nwith much less boilerplate and more ease.\nHighly polymorphic logic might be a good example of this,\nit is much straight forward to do that in Dynamically Typed languages\nwith simple <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing\">duck typing</a> that it is with Statically typed languages\nby using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming\">generics</a>, <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/templates\">templates</a> or other mechanisms.</p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://instil.co/blog/static-vs-dynamic-types/#generic-programming-and-simpler-errors\">article</a> has some good illustrations of this.</p>\n<p>There is a <strong>multi dimensional space</strong>\nthat has axis such as <strong>development speed</strong>, <strong>correctness verification</strong>,\n<strong>memory safety</strong>, <strong>performance</strong>, <strong>ergonomics</strong>, etc that\nProgramming Languages need to navigate.</p>\n<p>In particular, programming languages will be better at some\nof these dimensions and worse at others,\nright now there isn’t a perfect language that maximises\nall dimensions although there has been an explosion of programming\nlanguages in the past 10 years with things such as\n<a href=\"https://golang.org/\">Go</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/\">Rust</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/\">C#</a>, <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">Typescript</a>,\namong others that take a lot of the lessons of the past and\noverall they achieve more than previous languages,\nonly because of the iterative effect of technology.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rust maximises correctness, memory safety and performance,\nbut that makes it more difficult to understand for newcomers in general.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Take Rust for example, which I really like and that has taught me a lot,\nit is a language that tries to <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/\">maximise correctness, memory safety and performance</a>\nand the Rust team understands perfectly that these\nthings hurt expressiveness and development speed and\nalthough they actively try to improve the developer experience\nthey always maximise correctness, memory safety and performance first,\nand never they hurt those core values because of developer experience,\nand so Rust is widely known as a language\non the hard to learn side, verbose and that for certain highly\ndynamic cases you will end up both struggling and resorting to a variety\nof escape hatches.</p>\n<p>But in a lot of ways Rust is better than its peers (C / C++ mostly),\nit has better memory safety, a much more expressive\nType system, it provides higher level abstractions\nthat compile down to very efficient code,\nit does have a <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/mod.html\">modern module system</a>\ninstead of the header file system that I do believe is outdated and verbose,\nit replaces C/C++ build config files such as <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Makefile\">Makefiles</a> (and others)\nwith a standard abstraction: <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/\">cargo</a>,\nit provides a single standard mechanism for\nlibrary publishing, distribution and consumption: <code class=\"language-text\">cargo</code> and <a href=\"https://crates.io/\">crates.io</a>\ninstead of the multiple non standard ways C/C++ deal with these sort of things.</p>\n<p>But this is also not about bashing C/C++ which,\nalthough they have drawbacks as every tool out there,\nare super mature tools with mature ecosystems,\nlibraries, documentation, etc, that are hard to beat\nin a lot of senses, in fact a lot of the major mission critical\nsoftware we use currently relies heavily on them like\n<a href=\"https://github.com/openssl/openssl\">openssl</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux\">Linux</a> which is the base for <a href=\"https://github.com/aosp-mirror/kernel_common\">android</a>, to name a few.\nC++ in particular has made a lot of strives towards\ncorrectness, ergonomics and more and if you really need\nthe performance, C/C++ are conservative choices that will most likely work.</p>\n<p>And what about PHP? Have you seen it recently? It is far from\na perfect language and I personally do not resonate with it but\nit has come a long way from its very humble and chaotic beginnings.\nRecently it has added <a href=\"https://wiki.php.net/rfc/return_types\">type hints</a>, <a href=\"https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/306749/is-php7-a-static-or-dynamic-typed-language/306755\">partial static type checking</a>,\nit has added <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.traits.php\">traits</a>, has <a href=\"https://www.zend.com/blog/php-7\">increased its performance</a>,\nand with modern frameworks such as <a href=\"https://laravel.com/\">Laravel</a> developers can actually write\nvery decent programs with it. And let’s not mention the amount of community\nsupport, pervasive cheap hosting and more that it has.</p>\n<h2 id=\"problem-space-framework\" style=\"position:relative;\">Problem space framework<a href=\"#problem-space-framework\" aria-label=\"problem space framework permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Let me try to list some of the important aspects I consider when trying to evaluate\nprogramming tools objectively. Again, you and your team will most likely\nuse your subjective biases to select them but I do believe it is nice to have at least\na semi structured, objective, way of evaluating tools like Programming languages</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ergonomics / dev speed / dev experience / expressiveness</li>\n<li>documentation / resources available / popularity</li>\n<li>maturity</li>\n<li>ecosystem / available libraries and their quality</li>\n<li>ecosystem / tooling such as IDEs</li>\n<li>is it actively maintained?</li>\n<li>how good is the community around it?</li>\n<li>long term status of the project</li>\n<li>performance</li>\n<li>type safety / correctness verification</li>\n<li>memory safety / memory management strategies (only for programming languages)</li>\n<li>fits my use case?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So for example, you might like Rust because of its\nperformance, memory safety and correctness but you want\nto do <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3onjpuR\">Machine Learning</a> then you most likely\nwill need to use Python because of its <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3onjpuR\">blooming ecosystem</a>,\nand although you can statically check modern Python you will\nmost likely work with untyped codebases or examples\nand if you give it a chance you will end up understanding where it’s coming from.</p>\n<p>Another nice example is the infamous Javascript’s <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop#event_loop\">event-loop</a>.\nI’ve heard so many people bashing it, complaining about\nJs not having threads, complaining about this weird\nthing that an event loop is, but with <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function\">async / await</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\">promises</a>\nyou get a very ergonomic way of expressing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)\">concurrent</a> “tasks”\nwithout resorting to manual thread managing which\nis a well known <a href=\"https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/81003/how-to-explain-why-multi-threading-is-difficult\">hard</a> <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2956540_The_Problem_with_Threads\">thing</a> to do 100% correct.\nIn fact there are user level implementations of\nevent loops in <a href=\"https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/3-ev/\">C</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio\">Rust</a> (and probably\nin a lot more places) where although these\nlanguages support threads they recognise that for\ncertain applications having\nan event loop is a pretty good way of managing concurrent tasks.\nAnother modern way of managing concurrent task is Go’s <a href=\"https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1\">goroutines</a>,\nthat have a higher level api that hides the manual managing of threads.</p>\n<h2 id=\"is-javascript-the-best-programming-language-in-the-world\" style=\"position:relative;\">Is Javascript the best programming language in the world?<a href=\"#is-javascript-the-best-programming-language-in-the-world\" aria-label=\"is javascript the best programming language in the world permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I would say no, by a long shot, but does that mean\nthat it is 100% trash? Also no, by a long shot.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Javascript’s closures and functions\nas a first class citizens make up\nvery expressive and powerful primitives to build complex abstractions</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For example, in my opinion, closures and functions as a first class\ncitizens make up very expressive and powerful primitives to build\ncomplex abstractions on top of, in fact\nthese things are inherited from the <a href=\"https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/let.html\">lisp family</a> and are well understood tools,\nfrom the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/38iYm6W\">blooming origins</a> of Computer Science and programming languages.\nWe cannot also deny that, although\nextremely chaotic, the NPM ecosystem is a boilerplate\nof very good ideas that have shaped the way we develop\nJavascript applications.</p>\n<p>Does Javascript has bad parts? Lots!\nIn fact there’s a now mostly outdated but very\n<a href=\"https://amzn.to/38lEMqF\">popular book</a> about that.\nBut Javascript is starting to pick up the pace and\nhas made huge improvements in the past couple\nof years with native module syntax which is very good\nin my opinion (although native support is still far behind),\nnative class support that mostly works as you’d expect it,\nuser land hygienic macro system: <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/\">babel</a>,\nblooming statically typed variants such as Typescript and Flow\nand so much more make Javascript a very solid choice\nfor a lot of projects.</p>\n<p>Is it the best for all projects?\nMost likely not, but understanding its trade off\nwill give you solid fundamentals to make up a better\neducated choice of your tool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-do-we-love-or-hate-inanimate-things\" style=\"position:relative;\">Why do we love or hate inanimate things?<a href=\"#why-do-we-love-or-hate-inanimate-things\" aria-label=\"why do we love or hate inanimate things permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I believe that in the bottom of this discussion lies\nthe emotions and feelings we get towards tools, it happens\nin programming, it happens in woodworking, it happens generally\nin arts and craftsmanship.</p>\n<p>I think that the toxic hate you sometimes see in programming boils down\nto 1) we tend to fall in love with certain tools because of all the amazing\nthings we can accomplish with them and this love also generates hate\ntowards obvious competitors (i.e. Dynamically vs Statically typed languages);\nand 2) because of the meme quality of these tropes we as a developers maintain over time;\nthese rules of thumb that lead as to say things such as\n<em>“Statically typing is bad because Java is verbose, you better use Node.js”</em>.\nThis is sometimes referred to as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult\">Cargo Cult</a></p>\n<p>So we build these sort of <em>prejudice</em> and ill informed conceptions of tools\nthat we might only understand superficially instead of objectively and holistically,\nand this is something that seems to be part of the human nature since we build\n<em>prejudice</em> for people, animals, tools, places, etc. Humans are emotional beings\nand we require a conscious effort to avoid having raw emotional subjective responses\nto everything around us, but that’s just the Engineer mind set that ends up being\nmore constructive and positive for our careers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\">Conclusion<a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Programming is such a new and exciting but very complex discipline that the variety of solutions\nfor a given problem might be very large and it is important that we as developers develop (pun intended)\nan objective way of understanding these solutions, their trade offs and how to chose\namong them; and perhaps how to combine them and add up their strengths.\nIn end there will be always tools we enjoy using more than others\nbut that doesn’t necessarily mean that those tools are objectively\nuniversally better and the others are trash, it just that we like them,\nthey resonate with our minds or perhaps we simply\ngot more experience with them.</p>\n<p>And perhaps some day we will find out the <em>perfect programming language</em> but\nwe would still need to consider its ecosystem, support, community experience,\ndevelopers available and so many other things before adopting it to our projects.</p>\n<p>In the end, this post is just me giving a message of <strong>understanding,\nempathy and compassion for our fellow developers</strong>\nthat try to make a living in this very complex world of programming.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Like the content?
