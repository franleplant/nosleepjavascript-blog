We have a very weird and incorrect understanding of what being wealthy means\nthanks to TV, Movies and now Social Media and, spoiler alert, most of the Millionaires in United States\nare hard working men and women that live frugally, are great savers and live well below their means and\nwith the extra cash they can commit to long term conservative investments, generating\nlong term wealth.</p>\n<p>So yes, being wealthy usually does not mean having tons of super expensive cars, good looking human partners,\nsail boats in the Mediterranean, mansions and careless expending. These in fact are roads towards being\npoor actually in most cases and are only part of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious\">Collective unconscious</a>.</p>\n<p>I recommend reading this book because it talks a lot about building wealth and saving, activities that\nare super important as a foundational steps towards investing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"step-2-a-random-walk-down-wall-street\" style=\"position:relative;\">Step 2: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Xr4MMo\">A Random Walk Down Wall Street</a><a href=\"#step-2-a-random-walk-down-wall-street\" aria-label=\"step 2 a random walk down wall street permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Suggested formats: Digital, Paper and great as audiobook</p>\n<div style=\" display: flex;

And a lot of the material covered is directly related to what was happening then. In fact, there is a particularly good session where Andre Lo teaches about how a pool of investments can be structured and resold via the “Trench” technique. And the abuse and misuse of this techniques is one of the main culprits of the financial crisis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We conclude then that this course is well timed, complete and overall amazing for all levels.</p>\n<p>You might get lost here or there when they go to calculating the price of futures and options when they start\nusing second derivatives and infinite series expansions but with the proper patience you can come to either\nunderstand it or simply mark it as “TODO” (developer slang for <em>that which remains to be done</em>).</p>\n<p>Additionally this course follows very closely the material\ncovered in the book <em>“Principles of Corporate Finance”</em>\nfrom <em>“Richard Brealey, Stewart Myers, Franklin Allen”</em>\nwhich I believe is a great book overall.</p>\n<p>You can easily opt for just one of these resources or\nwork them together since they complement each other so much.</p>\n<p>These last two resources actually cover probably more than you want to know but they are a very good\nresource if you really want to know some of the nitty-gritty details behind all this complex instruments.</p>\n<p>A specially useful section is the one where they cover the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp\">Modern Portfolio theory</a>, after you learn this you will\nunderstand one of the most important aspects of being a successfully investor:\n<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversification.asp\">Diversification</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-note-on-crypto\" style=\"position:relative;\">A note on crypto<a href=\"#a-note-on-crypto\" aria-label=\"a note on crypto permalink\" class=\"header-anchor after\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Some of the material here does translate to the crypto world.
